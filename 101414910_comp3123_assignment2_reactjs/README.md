# Title : Employee Management - Full stack Development Using ReactJS and Nodejs

I have created Employee Management System using backend and frontend. I have used Nodejs and express for backend and for frontend its ReactJs. I am using MongoDB atlas for database as I have used in my 1st assignment that I continued over. I have chose to deploy it on Vercel, both frontend and backend seperately. 

The User can Login and Signup using email and username. They can also perform CRUD operation on Employee List. Ther is search bar function to search Employee in employee list by their position and Department.
